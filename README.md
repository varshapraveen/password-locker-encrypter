This is a Java-based password manager designed to help users generate, encrypt, store, retrieve, and manage passwords securely. 
The project ensures data security using SHA-1 hashing with salting for encryption and implements a hash table with linear probing for efficient storage and retrieval. 
The graphical user interface, built with Java Swing, provides an intuitive experience for seamless interaction.

Features
The application allows users to generate strong, random passwords based on user-defined criteria. 
It encrypts passwords using SHA-1 with salting for enhanced security and stores them efficiently using a custom hash table. 
Users can retrieve stored passwords when needed and delete them when no longer required. 
The system includes a simple and user-friendly interface, along with an integrated splash screen for a smooth startup experience.

Technologies Used
The project is developed using Java with a graphical interface built in Java Swing. 
It employs SHA-1 hashing with salting for encryption and uses a custom hash table with linear probing for password storage and retrieval.

Usage Instructions
Users can generate a secure password by clicking the generate password button. 
The encrypt password option allows users to securely hash a password before storage. 
The store password function saves credentials for various accounts, while the search password feature retrieves stored credentials. 
Users can delete passwords when they are no longer needed.

Future Enhancements
Planned improvements include upgrading to SHA-256 or AES for stronger encryption, 
implementing multi-factor authentication for added security, enabling cloud synchronization for cross-device access, 
and developing a browser extension for auto-filling credentials.
